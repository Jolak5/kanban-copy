# Awesome books: refactor to use JavaScript classes

## Learning objectives

- Use JavaScript classes.

### Estimated time: 3h

## Description

In this project, you will refactor the **Awesome books** application to use JavaScript `classes`.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct [GitHub flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### JavaScript requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements

- Use JavaScript `classes` instead of `objects` and `arrays`.
  - You can use objects and arrays, but do it *inside* classes.
- Create class `methods` to add and remove books.
- Maintain all of the original functionality of the application (i.e. no bugs were introduced while refactoring).
- Don't use any library or framework, use only plain JavaScript.
