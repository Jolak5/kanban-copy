# Awesome books: with ES6

## Learning objectives

- Use ES6 modules to write modular JavaScript.
- Learn how to use proper ES6 syntax.
- Understand improvements that ES6 brings to JavaScript.
- Use npm as software packages system.

### Estimated time: 4.5h

## Description

In this project, you will restructure your _Awesome books_ app code. The goal is to make it more organized by using modules.
You will also practice the ES6 syntax that you have learned.


*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct [GitHub Flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### HTML/CSS requirements

- Follow our list of the [best practices for HTML & CSS](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/html_css_best_practices.md).

### JavaScript requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements

- Setup your project:
  - Create a new directory and initialize it with git.
  - Use `npm init -y` command to create package.json file.
  - Create the entry point for your JavaScript code called `index.js`
  - Create `index.css` file for your styles.
  - Create the main `index.html` file. Link your `index.js` and `index.css` files there.
  - Create a directory called `modules`.
- Re-create your _Awesome books_ app following the rules:
  - Use ES6 syntax.
  - Divide your code into modules. Save each module in a separate file in the `modules` dir. Import modules in the `index.js` file. For this exercise - the more modules the better!
  - Keep all funcionalities of the app without errors.
  - Refactor your methods and functions to arrow functions.
  - Use let and const in a correct way.

 
- Display the current date below the navigation bar. 
  - For this requirement you should use a library [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/install?id=es6)
  - Download the script and save it to your project. 
  - Import it as a module.
  - See the article [Get the current date and time](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/tour?id=get-the-current-date-and-time). Your task here is to use a new tool effectively with little externally curated support. Exactly as you will do in your future job.
