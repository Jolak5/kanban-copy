# Awesome books: a complete website with navigation

## Learning objectives

- Understand the concept of single page application.
- Use JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements.
- Use JavaScript events.

### Estimated time: 4.5h

## Description

In this project, you will take the *Awesome books* application and convert it into a fully functional website. You will refactor the project to add three new sections on top of the two sections you have already completed: *Books list* (done), *Add book* form (done), a new *Contact info* section, a *Navigation bar*, and a *Footer*.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct [GitHub Flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### HTML/CSS requirements

- Follow our list of the [best practices for HTML & CSS](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/html_css_best_practices.md).

### JavaScript requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements

- Modify the Awesome books application to have:
  - A Navigation bar.
  - Three content sections:
    1. Books list.
    2. Add book form.
    3. Contact info.

- Use this wireframe as a guide:
<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/awesome_books_full_website.png" alt="Basic UI"  width="900px"/>
</p>

- Make sure that when you click on any of the links, the main area changes to display only one of the three content sections. (Hint: you can simply add and remove CSS classes to display or hide the content.)
- To change the contents of the page, don't use any library or framework, use only plain JavaScript and CSS.

# Additional requirements

*These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, feel free to implement them. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.*
