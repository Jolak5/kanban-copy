# Awesome books: plain JS with objects

## Learning objectives
- Use JavaScript objects as design pattern.
- Use developer tools to print information to the console.

### Estimated time: 3h

## Description
In the first milestone of this project you will learn:
- How to use JS objects to represent a book.
- How to add/remove books from a book list and render the list.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct [Github Flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### Project requirements

- Create a collection that keeps a list of books (hint: you can use an array of objects for that).
- Create a method to add a new book to the collection, with title and author.
- Create a method to remove a book from the collection (hint: you can use the [array filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) method).
- Display all books saved in the collection in the top part of the page.
- Make sure that when a user clicks the "Add" button:
  - A new book is added to the collection.
  - The new book is displayed in the page.
- Make sure that when a user clicks the "Remove" button:
  - The right book is removed from the collection.
  - The right book dissapears from the page.
- Make sure that data is preserved in the browser's memory by using [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) (hint: you may also need to use [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) `parse()` and `stringify()` methods).
- To debug your application, you can use [console.log()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log)
- Implement only a basic UI with plain HTML:
