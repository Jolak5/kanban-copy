# Sneak peek: Awesome books

## Learning objectives
- Understand how to use medium-fidelity wireframes to create a UI.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

"Awesome books" is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list.
By building this application, you will learn how to manage data using JavaScript. Thanks to that your website will be more interactive.
You will also use a medium-fidelity wireframe to build the UI.

### What is a medium-fidelity wireframe?

Medium-fidelity wireframes present how your website's elements should be arranged, but they skip detailed information about aesthetics (e.g., colors, images).
They can assist with communicating to teams how aesthetic features can support essential functionalities. Please read [Low Fidelity Wireframes vs High Fidelity Wireframes](https://mentormate.com/blog/low-fidelity-wireframes-vs-high-fidelity-wireframes/) to fully understand the difference between low-, medium-, and high-fidelity wireframes.

### How to build the "Awesome books" website

You will start by building the core functionalities and ignoring how your website looks. At the very beginning your website will look similar to the UI below. Note that it is plain HTML with no styling, but it will allow you to add and remove books from the list!

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/awesome_books_basic_ui.png" alt="Basic UI" width="300px" />
</p>

Once you have the code working, you will style the core elements: the books list and the form for adding a new book. You will need to adhere to the layout presented in the wireframe, but you will choose your application's styling. So your initial ugly HTML will turn into something similar to this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/awesome_books_core_elements.png" alt="Core elements" width="400px"  />
</p>

In the last step, you will build a complete website with working navigation. Again styling is your choice, but it is essential to adhere to the layout presented in the wireframe. Your end result should look similar to this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/awesome_books_full_website.png" alt="Full website" />
</p>

### Projects list

You will be building your "Awesome books" website for the whole week. Here is the list of projects that will guide you through the steps described above. You will find details about each of the project requirements in the upcoming program activities. In all of the projects, you will be working collaboratively by using pair-programming.

- Project 1: Manage books collection (plain JS with objects).
- Project 2: Manage books collection (plain JS with classes).
- Project 3: Style core elements of the page.
- Project 4: Create a complete website with navigation.
