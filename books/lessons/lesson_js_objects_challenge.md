# Creating objects: functions constructors vs Object constructor

You can use the [Object() constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/Object), which will create an *object wrapper* in which you'll need to add properties.

Using the [constructor function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#using_a_constructor_function) you can create a function that will return an object with properties.
