# Dynamic websites with JavaScript - Introduction to Single Page Applications

## Learning objectives

- Use JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements.
- Use JavaScript events.
- Understand the concept of Single Page Application.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this lesson, you will refresh your knowledge on how to manipulate the DOM and work with events to make your websites dynamic. With that as a foundation, you will learn the basics of Single Page Applications (SPA).

### Why are dynamic websites important?

Without JavaScript, websites would be static, in other words, they will look and behave always the same. To see any new content you would need to navigate to another page and make a new request to the server. But using JavaScript you can allow the user to interact with the page, respond to changes, send and receive data, etc.

### Manipulating the DOM

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a representation of all the elements of an HTML document (or web page). Using JavaScript you can manipulate these elements, adding and removing them or changing their contents. You have already learned about DOM manipulation in the previous module's lesson. As a refresher please:

- Read the article [JavaScript HTML DOM Events](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp) and complete all of the *Try It Yourself* exercises. Thanks to that you will practice how to change DOM elements contents.


### Single Page Applications

A traditional web application is composed of several pages, each one making a request to the server to download its contents (which is an expensive operation). Single Page Applications, on the other hand, consist of **a single page!** , they are capable of sending and receiving data without the need of reloading the whole page and rewrite its content dynamically. SPA's are a very complex and fast-changing topic. There are a lot of libraries and frameworks to build SPA's - in the following module you will learn one of the most popular libraries: React. But, please, be patient! For now, just take a look at the basic concepts of SPA's:

## Additional materials [optional header]
**These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, here are some resources to help you. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.**

Take a look at the [Single Page Applicatons Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application), it's a very complete, long article, where you can find the history of SPA's and the web technologies that made them possible, like Ajax, maybe the most important innovation for the development of SPA's.
