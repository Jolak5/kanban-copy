# Leaderboard: final touches

## Learning objectives

- Understand how to use medium-fidelity wireframes to create a UI.

### Estimated time: 4h

## Description

In this activity you will finalize the *Leaderboard list* app, adding the styles needed to make it look great.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct flow [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### HTML/CSS requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for HTML & CSS](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/html_css_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements

- At this point you should have a fully working app that uses only basic styles to make the layout work, according to this wireframe:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/leaderboard_wireframe.png" alt="Basic UI"  width="500px"/>
</p>

- Now you should improve the *look and feel* of the application, adding the styles of your choice.
- Please keep the general layout of the wireframe, this is the only mandatory requirement.
- You can use plain CSS or any CSS framework, it's up to you.
