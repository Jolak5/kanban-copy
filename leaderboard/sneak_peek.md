# Sneak peek: Leaderboard

## Learning objectives

- Understand how to use medium-fidelity wireframes to create a UI.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved thanks to the external [Leaderboard API service](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Leaderboard-API-service-24c0c3c116974ac49488d4eb0267ade3).

### How to build the leaderboard website

For this application the priority is to create a working version of the leaderboard that preserves user input. You will build a website according to the wireframe:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/leaderboard_wireframe.png" alt="Wireframe" />
</p>

Then, you will connect to the Leaderboard API (as described in its [documentation]((https://www.notion.so/microverse/Leaderboard-API-service-24c0c3c116974ac49488d4eb0267ade3))) in order to implement the actions behind the "Refresh" and "Submit" buttons. In the last step, you will play with async & await and add as much styling as possible in the given time.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** This is the first time you will use [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md). Keep that in mind!

### Projects list

You will be building the leaderboard website during the whole week. Here is the list of projects that will guide you through the steps described above. You will find details about each of the milestone requirements in the upcoming program activities.

- Project 1: basic page structure.
- Project 2: send and receive data from API.
- Project 3: final touches.
