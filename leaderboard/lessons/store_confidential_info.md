# How to store confidential API-related information in a secure way

## Learning objectives

- Store confidential API-related information in a secure way.

### Estimated time: 0.25h

## Description

In this lesson, we will focus on a small yet important topic. The security of the API information. You will learn how to store confidential information in a way that will not put your data source at risk.

### Why is it important?

As an API is exposing data, it is usually protected in some way. Especially if the API not only allows you to read the data but also to change it. Imagine if anybody who has a link to some bank‘s API could add money to user accounts. That would have serious negative consequences, wouldn’t it? Depending on the risk level, different APIs might require different actions. It can be authentication or simply personalized links. No matter what it is, you should never store the information that can put data at risk in your GitHub repo. 

### Storing confidential information

- First, read [5 best practices for secure API key storage](https://developers.amadeus.com/blog/best-practices-api-key-storage).
- Then, check [how to manage API keys in JavaScript app](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/javascript-part-time-react-track/asynchrony-and-apis-81b92804-5afe-4d1a-8209-5d9a3d3524e1/managing-api-keys). Remember that this technique can be used for securing other kinds of confidential information as well.
