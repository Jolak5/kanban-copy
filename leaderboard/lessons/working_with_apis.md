# Working with APIs

## Learning objectives

- Send and receive data from an API.
- Use API documentation.
- Identify if an API is RESTful or not.

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn what an API is, identify different types of APIs, how to consume an API, and how to check its documentation.

### Why are APIs important?

An **Application Programming Interface** (API) is an *intermediary* that allows two applications to talk to each other. When you need to send or receive data from/to a server, you need to know *how* to ask for that data and the format or *shape* in which that data is coming to you. APIs are fundamental to keep the internet running since almost every application needs data from one or several sources. If every API was implemented in a different way, it would be really hard to learn how to work with each one. That's why APIs follow conventions, a set of guidelines to make APIs compatible and predictable. One of the most widely used conventions is the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style.

### REST and other kinds of APIs

Technically, you can create an API in any way, but if you don't follow any conventions people won't know how to use it. To have a common language for APIs, several styles or conventions are followed. Nowadays, the most popular is REST. REST is not a protocol or technology, is just a set of guidelines and best practices that you should follow. The main concept behind REST is *resources*.

To learn more about APIs and REST, read these articles:

- [What is an API? In English, please](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82/), a general introduction to APIs.
- [What is REST?](https://restfulapi.net/), an introduction to REST APIs.
- [API 101: What Is a REST API?](https://blog.postman.com/rest-api-definition/) to understand the concept of resources.

### How to consume an API

There are several ways to *consume* an API, read [this aticle](../articles/how_to_consume_api.md) to learn some of them.

## Additional materials

**These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, here are some resources to help you. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.**
