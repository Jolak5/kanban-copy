# JSON

## Learning objectives

- Understand and use JSON.
- Make JavaScript code asynchronous.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this lesson you will learn what JSON is and how to use the JSON format to exchange data over the internet.

### Why is JSON important?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a standardized format used to send and receive structured data. JSON is not the only format to exchange data, but is the most used, particularly in APIs.

### Working with JSON

JSON is not JavaScript. While it seems like a JavaScript object, it is plain text that merely uses JavaScript Object notation (syntax). Because of that, you have to convert JSON from plain text to JavaScript using the `JSON.parse()` method, and from objects to text using the `JSON.stringify()` method. To learn more about JSON, read the following guide from MDN:

## Additional materials
**These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, here are some resources to help you. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.**

You can practice [JSON.parse()](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_parse.asp) and [JSON.stringify()](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_stringify.asp) in W3Schools.
