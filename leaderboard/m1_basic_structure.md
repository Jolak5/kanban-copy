# Leaderboard: setup project

## Learning objectives

- Use callbacks and promises.
- Learn how to use proper ES6 syntax.
- Use ES6 modules to write modular JavaScript.
- Use webpack to bundle JavaScript.

### Estimated time: 2h

## Description

In this activity you will set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using *webpack* and *ES6* features, notably *modules*. You should develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling - just focus on functionality. In following activities, you will consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript *async* and *await* and add some styling.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### JavaScript requirements

  - Follow our list of [best practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements


- **IMPORTANT NOTE** This is the first time you will use [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md). Keep that in mind!
- Create an **npm project with webpack**. (If you need a refresher, check the previous project or webpack exercise).
- Write plain HTML markup with minimum styling (just to make the layout), because you will implement styles in the following steps. Use this wireframe as a guide:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/leaderboard_wireframe.png" alt="Basic UI"  width="500px"/>
</p>

- Don't make API calls (you'll do it in a following lesson).
- Use ES6 modules, with *import* and *export*.
