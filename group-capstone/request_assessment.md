## Description

You have worked on your capstone project with your team. Then you recorded a video with a presentation of the project and you mastered the learning objectives related to that. Now it's time to request the assessment!

## Instructions

- Make sure that the README of your capstone project includes the following information:
    - A link to the online version of your app.
    - A link to your Kanban board.
    - A list of all team members.
    - Links to the pull requests with code reviews that you are the proudest of!
- Copy the main link to the GH repository with your project (**at this moment its final version should be in the main branch**).
- Copy a link to your video presentation.
- Request the assessment as described below.

### Request assessment

- Go to your Student Dashboard, then click Actions → Request assessment.
- To request the assessment you need to include the link to the GH repository with your project and a link to your video submission.
- The status of this activity should change to `Pending assessment`.
- **It is important to request the evaluation on Friday, so your assessor can perform the assessment before Saturday’s deadline (the whole process can take up to 12 hours).**
- *NOTE: each team member needs to request the assessment individually.*

### Your final score

- Once we get the review from 2 assessors, the status of this activity will change to either `Complete` or `Incomplete` and you will be able to go back to your score breakdown by going to Student Dashboard → View score.
- *The full description of the final score and partial scores can be found in [this article](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/group-capstone/articles/assessment_score.md).*
