## Description

### Why this project is different from any other project you’ve created at Microverse?

There are three reasons:

- This is the first project you’ll do on a team
- This is the first project in which a code review is not an assessment but advice for you
- This is the first project in which you are responsible for showing us that you have mastered the learning objectives

Before watching the video below, make sure that you have read the following articles:

- [Project requirements](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/group-capstone/buisness_requirements.md)
- [Score description](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/group-capstone/articles/assessment_score.md)
- [Assessment rubric](https://www.notion.so/230916623f554b4dbe43c688c0879010)

**Rules to remember**

1. You will be assessed individually but you should work on the project with your team.
2. In order to be assessed you need to:
    1. Build a project in a team.
    2. Record a video presentation individually.
3. You need to master all learning objectives but we will ask you to answer the questions about randomly selected learning objectives. You will receive the list on the day of recording your presentation.
4. You need to submit a link to the presentation and to the repository with your project.
5. In order to pass you:
    1. need to get at least 50 points out of 72 (which is 70%)
    2. need to get >1 point for any of the assessed learning objectives.

### Main points from the video

Read all of the below points and discuss them with your team.

<details>
<summary>The main goal</summary>
The main goal of this project is to ensure that you have mastered all crucial learning objectives from the current module and that you can work in a team.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Opportunities to prove that you have the skills to collaborate effectively in order to deliver a JavaScrip app</summary>

<ol>
<li>You got business requirements and a kanban board that will help you to divide the work amongst your team.</li>
<li>While you will be assessed individually, the main requirement is that you can work with other people collaboratively to create a product requested by a client. </li>

<li>You will need to answer a sample of randomly selected questions about technical and soft skills during the presentation. However, you still need to master all of the learning objectives as you will only learn which questions you will need to answer on the last day of the block.</li>

<li>Taking ownership of your learning process. This time the assessment starts with your self-assessment and readiness to say: I mastered those learning objectives! That’s why we shared the assessment rubric with you at the beginning of this module.</li>
</ol>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Challenges</summary>

<ul>
<li>Unexpected issues causing delays (e.g. problems with installations, bugs that take a few days to get fixed, underestimated tasks).</li>
<li>Conflict in the team (e.g. which approach to use, what is the biggest priority).</li>
<li>Difficult decision to be made (e.g. should I focus on my part or should I help my team member?).</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Space for overcoming challenges</summary>
<ul>
<li> <b>Kanban board</b>: We prepared a board for you with tasks distributed between team members, so you do not need to spend time on it.</li>
<li> <b>Chance to explain</b>: If you are able to show your working app with a couple of requirements missing BUT you can explain what happened you can pass the assessment if you find a way to show in your video that you have mastered all learning objectives from the rubric.</li>
<li> <b>Code reviews before evaluation</b>: Ask for a code review and treat it as advice.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Suggested strategy</summary>
<ol>
<li> Invest time in organizing your work:

<ul>
<li> Create working agreements.</li>
<li> Follow the kanban board.</li>

<li> Support other team members.</li>

<li> Make sure that the code you write shows that you mastered the learning objectives.</li>
</ul>

 </li>

<li> Act professional: 

<ul>

<li> Do not stress too much about the deadline.</li>
<li>Remember that you can always explain why something is not perfect on your website. As long as you are professional about it, all is good.</li>

 <li>Think about how you can show that you have mastered all learning objectives from the rubric even if you did not finish all required features on time.</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li> Communicate crucial issues as early as possible:
<ul>
<li>Re-organize your team and reach out to the Student Success team.</li>
