# Assessment score

## Description

Your assessment score reflects how well you mastered the crucial learning objectives in the current module. It takes into account your technical skills and soft skills. The main question this score is trying to answer is: are you able to build the product requested by the client in a given technology stack and explain what skills you used in order to achieve that?

## Rules

The maximum score is 72 points. It consists of 5 partial scores described below. In order to pass the assessment you need to get at least 70% (min 50 points) and you need to get >1 point for all of the assessed learning objectives.

*As this is the first presentation you need to create for the assessment, we will be a bit more forgiving if you forget about a couple of questions.

## Partial scores
