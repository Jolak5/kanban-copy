### Estimated time: 20.5h

## Description

The JavaScript capstone project ([remember what capstone projects are?](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/capstone_intro.md)) is about building your own web application based on an external API. You will select an API that provides data about a topic that you like and then build the web app around it. The web app will have 2 or 3 user interfaces (depending on the size of your team):

- A home page showing a list of items that you can "like."
- A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to comment on it or reserve it for a period of time.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct [gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### HTML/CSS & JavaScript requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for HTML & CSS](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/html_css_best_practices.md).
- Follow our list of [best practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements

**APIs**

- First, you need to find an API so you can base the development of the webapp around it. The API should allow you to:
    - Get a list of items with a unique item id (or generate the unique id).
    - For a given item, get detailed information about it.
    
    We recommend that you choose an API that **doesn't need authentication**. if you select an API that requires authentication, you should implement it on your own. Also, if you select an API that provides **image** resources, your webapp will be more visual which will make it more appealing.
    
    Some example APIs are:
    
    - [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/): data about the Pok√©mon world.
    - [TVmaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api): data about TV series and movies.
    - [Meals DB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php): data about meals.

You can find more APIs in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) or in [ProgrammableWeb](https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis). Some of the APIs require a token, some require authentication, and some others are just open.

- You will use our [Involvement API](https://www.notion.so/869e60b5ad104603aa6db59e08150270) to record the different user interactions (likes, comments and reservations).

**Interfaces**

- You should build these interfaces:
    - The *home page*.
    - The *comments popup*.
    - The *reservations popup* (only for the groups of 3 students).
- You should follow the layout of the wireframes provided. You should personalize the rest of the design including colors, typographies, spacings, etc.
- Home page
    - When the page loads, the webapp retrieves data from:
        - The selected API and shows the list of items on screen.
        - The Involvement API to show the item likes.
    - Remember that your page should make only 2 requests:
        - One to the base API.
        - And **one** to the Involvement API.
    - When the user clicks on the Like button of an item, the interaction is recorded in the Involvement API and the screen is updated.
    - When the user clicks on the "Comments" button, the Comments popup appears.
    - When the user clicks on the "Reservations" button, the Reservations popup appears (only for the groups of 3 students).
    - Home page header and navigation similar to the given mockup.
    - Home page footer similar to the given mockup.
- Comments popup
    - When the popup loads, the webapp retrieves data from:
        - The selected API and shows details about the selected item.
        - The Involvement API to show the item comments.
    - When the user clicks on the "Comment" button, the data is recorded in the Involvement API and the screen is updated.
- Reservations popup (only for the groups of 3 students)
    - When the popup loads, the webapp retrieves data from:
        - The selected API and shows details about the selected item.
        - The Involvement API to show the item reservations.
    - When the user clicks on the "Reserve" button, the data is recorded in the Involvement API and the screen is updated.

**Counters**
We have counters in all the interfaces that show:

- The number of items (home).
- The number of comments (comments popup).
- The number of reservations (reservations popup) - only for the groups of 3 students.

Even if the API gives you these numbers, you will create a specific function to calculate these numbers on each page. Respect the following rules:

- Each counter should be implemented as a separate module.
- A counter function should look for specific DOM elements (e.g. for the comments counter it should look for comments) and make the counting based on what is actually displayed on the page.
- A counter function should cover all the edge cases you can think about.

These counter functions need to be covered with unit tests using Jest. Make sure that you have tests for all edge cases.

**Technical set up**

- Set up the repository on GitHub and use gitflow.
- Set up webpack.
- Use modules to organize your code. You should have a separate directory for your modules ( `src/modules`). It is your responsibility to divide your code into logical chunks.
- Set up a JavaScript testing library (Jest). All your tests should be stored in one directory.

### Workload distribution

In order to tackle this challenge, we created [a template of the Kanban board with GitHub project](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/projects/1) that translates the requirements into a set of tasks that you will be able to use to organize your work. You will create your own copy of that board in the separate activity.

You will be working in this way:

- The common tasks (set up repo, find the API, shared work on the home page) will be divided among all of you or completed as a team (pair programming).
- The tasks related to a specific page will be developed individually, with every student owning the development of one page.
- All tasks should be based on the cards from your Kanban board.

Below you can see a suggestion of what you can do every day (just a suggestion, not mandatory).

**Day 0**

- Choose the topic for your website and the API.
- Choose images, text, icons, fonts.
- Set up the repository and tools.
- Create the basic shared code on the home page.

**Day 1**

- Start individual interfaces.
- Give code reviews to your teammates.

**Day 2**

- Work on individual interfaces.
- Give code reviews to your teammates.

**Day 3**

- Complete the work on individual interfaces.
- Create a good README.
- Ask for the external review - using your Student Dashboard.

**Day 4**

- Make final changes in your project.
- Record a video with your presentation.
- Request the assessment!

## Work and submission mode

- You should implement the above requirements only in **one repository** in your group.
- You should ask for a review and submit this activity **on behalf of your group.**
- You should use this project to ask for an assessment **individually.**

## Code review

You will give and receive code reviews with your teammates. Each task (i.e. each card) should have a separate pull request that is reviewed by one of your teammates. Be nice to your teammates and add a link to the PR in specific card comments.

**Remember that we will also assess how good you are at giving code reviews to others. Make sure that each of the team members will have a chance to show your assessor your code-reviewing skills! If you need you can check on [how to give a code review](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/give_code_review_basics.md) and how to do it in [the best possible way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/better_code_review.md).**

Once the entire project is ready, one of your team members will request a code review on behalf of your group. For both processes follow [these steps](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/code_review_flow_group_projects.md).

IMPORTANT NOTE: In this project, code reviews are not the final evaluation of your project. Their purpose is to help you to improve your project before you ask for the assessment. You can use up to 2 code reviews to ensure that your project is ready for the presentation. Requesting a code review is optional.

## Submit your project

You can submit your project at any point of the code review process. You do not need to wait for the code reviewer's approval. [Read this FAQ for a reminder on how to submit your project](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234).

Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit your project.

## Assessment

The project that you build as a team will be used in the video presentation that **each of the team members** needs to record.

In the presentation, you will need to show us the evidence that you have mastered a set of random [crucial learning objectives](https://www.notion.so/230916623f554b4dbe43c688c0879010). 

****You will need the pieces of code written by you, a code review performed by you, and your knowledge about specific concepts.****

You will be assessed by 3 independent assessors according to:

- [the score description](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/group-capstone/articles/assessment_score.md)
- [the rubric](https://www.notion.so/230916623f554b4dbe43c688c0879010)

Both documents above should be the guidelines for you to create a solid presentation. Remember that it is your ownership to prove that you have mastered all crucial learning objectives.

*Once you finish building the project, you will move to the activity in your dashboard that will ask you [to record the video presentatio](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/group-capstone/record_presentation.md)n.*

## Additional requirements

*These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, feel free to implement them. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.*

*If you decide to implement these requirements you should do it in a separate pull request. As always, remember to clearly document your decision in GitHub comments.*

- You could implement some UX improvements: including transitions and/or animations, etc.
- You can implement additional home pages, one page per category of items.
- Make sure that you have a decent mobile design for the web app.

**Remember to add cards to your Kanban board if you decide to implement additional tasks.**
