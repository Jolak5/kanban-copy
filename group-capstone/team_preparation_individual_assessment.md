# JavaScript group capstone: preparation with your team

## Learning objectives

- Understand how to use medium-fidelity wireframes to create a UI.
- Follow written requirements (e.g. user stories).
- Use gitflow to work with other developers in a team.
- Solve simple git merge conflicts.
- Write clear, professional, and respectful review comments for other team members.
- Explain why a change is requested when giving a code review.
- Perform a code review for a team member.

### Estimated time: 0.75h

## Description

This is the first time at Microverse that you will build a project in a group. Apart from technical knowledge, you will need to use a few new processes and tools. You have been preparing for that with a few individual tasks in the Microverse program, and it is time to connect all of them together.

**There is also a big difference in the way you are going to be assessed**. While you will build this project as a group, each of you will be assessed individually. In order to do that you will need to record a video in which you will present how you mastered the learning objectives.

In this video you will show your understanding of the project requirements and what you built to deliver those requirements.

### Why is preparation important?

Before you start splitting the work and coding, everyone must understand the task at hand. If you make sure that you are on the same page, your work will be more effective. Remember that the point of this lesson is to:

- Refresh yourself on the tools you need to use to work in a group
- Analyze business requirements and use a kanban board to help organize your team
- Refresh yourself on how to assess how well you have mastered learning objectives from the current module

*Read and discuss all of the following points with your team during the Zoom call.*

### Tools that will help you with collaboration

**Working with git**

For all group projects, you will use gitflow. Make sure that all of you:

- Understand how to use [gitflow and how to open pull requests with the `dev` branch as a base branch](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Know how to solve [git conflicts](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/conflicts_git.md). Your team will likely experience some merge conflicts.

*All links above are for lessons that you have already completed.*

**Code reviews**

For your group projects, you will be performing code reviews for your team members every day. Therefore, make sure that all of you:

- Know how to [perform a code review](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/give_code_review_basics.md).
- Remember how to [communicate well in code reviews](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/better_code_review.md).

*All links above are for lessons that you have already completed.*

**Code review flow for Microverse group projects**

For group projects, you will get code reviews from your teammates and external code reviewers; make sure that you understand the flow described in [this article](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/code_review_flow_group_projects.md).

*You have practiced it in group projects. Just make sure that every team member is familiar with this concept.*

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** In this project, code reviews are not the final evaluation of your project. Their purpose is to help you to improve your project **before** you ask for the assessment. You can use up to 2 code reviews to ensure that your project is ready for the presentation. *Requesting a code review is optional.*

**Collaboration difficulties**

‚ÄºÔ∏è üëâ  **If you experience difficulties while collaborating with your group, please reach out to Student Success right away [by filling out this form](https://airtable.com/shr8ApqXENQ0DSHto).** We are here to support you. Some difficulties might include a partner not showing up, a partner not doing their part of the work, or a partner not holding up their part of the agreement. We do not unpair students in group work, but we work with you to resolve the conflict. Reach out to Student Success earlier in the week, as that gives us more time to resolve the issue.üëà ‚ÄºÔ∏è

### Project requirements

- Now, it's time to read [the project requirements](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/tree/main/group-capstone/js_capstone.md). Treat it as a sneak peek and make sure that everybody on your team understands the challenge.
- For this first group project, we translated the above requirements into a [Kanban board with tasks](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/projects/1). Please take a quick look at it now, but **do not make any changes there.**
- In the next activity, you will create a copy of that Kanban board and start to assign tasks!

### Assessment

You will start your project today and continue working on it for the following 3 days. After that time you will have a chance to ask for an external code review (but only if you want to). On the last day of the week, you should make final changes in your project. Once it is ready, each of you will need to record a video with a presentation of your part of the work. Your presentation should follow the list of questions from the rubric that is shared with you beforehand.

While building your project you should make sure that it allows you to show evidence that you have mastered all learning objectives listed in the rubric below. In your video, **you will be asked to answer randomly selected questions that you will be given on the last day of the week.** Apart from the video, we will also check the code that you have written and how well your group collaborated together.

The full description of the score can be found in [this article](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/group-capstone/articles/assessment_score.md).

In order to prepare for the assessment, you will need to follow this [rubric which includes **all possible questions that can be asked.**](https://www.notion.so/JavaScript-group-capstone-rubric-230916623f554b4dbe43c688c0879010)

The same rubric will be used to assess your submission. You will get the assessment from 2 independent Code Reviewers. Based on their feedback we will calculate your score.

*Take a look at it now and discuss it with your group.*

*If you spot any bugs or issues in this activity, you can [open an issue with your proposed change](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/open_issue.md).*
