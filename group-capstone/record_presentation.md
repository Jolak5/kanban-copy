### How to record your presentation?

1. You should already be familiar with [the assessment score description](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/group-capstone/articles/assessment_score.md) and [rubric](https://www.notion.so/230916623f554b4dbe43c688c0879010) . Read them once again in order to remember what you are supposed to show in your video.
2. Prepare the outline of your presentation. Use the outline suggested in requirements as a starting point. Add as many details as you wish - the outline should help you to record the video and to remember about everything. Remember that the point is that you can show off all learning objectives.
3. Record the video
    - You can use Zoom, Loom, or a service of your choice.
    - You can record specific fragments and then join them into one video.
4. Double-check that your video takes ~30min (and not longer than 40 min).
5. Make sure that your video is accessible online.
    - You can upload it to YouTube, Google Drive, Loom storage, etc.
6. Copy the link to your video. It will be needed for this exercise submission and also for requesting an assessment of this module.
