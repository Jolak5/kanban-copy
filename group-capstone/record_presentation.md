### Step 1 - prepare your presentation

❗️ It is important that you prepare your presentation **before** recording it. You need to make sure that you comply with all requirements listed above.

1. You should already be familiar with [the assessment score description](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/group-capstone/articles/assessment_score.md) and [rubric](https://www.notion.so/230916623f554b4dbe43c688c0879010). Read them once again in order to remember what you are supposed to show in your video.
2. Prepare the outline of your presentation. Use the **outline that you have received via e-mail today** as a starting point. 
    - Think about what are you going to say about yourself and your project.
    - Prepare your answers for all questions.
    - Think about what are you going to show on your screen: specific lines of code, pull requests, features in the app, etc.
3. Add as many details as you wish but be conscious about the time. The outline should help you to record the video and to remember everything. Remember that the point is that you can show off your knowledge according to the [rubric](https://www.notion.so/230916623f554b4dbe43c688c0879010).
4. Practice your presentation - you might need a few attempts to record a final video.

### Step 2 - recording the presentation

1. Keep your presentation outline open or make handwritten notes of what you are going to present.
2. Record the video
    - You can use Zoom, Loom, or a service of your choice.
    - You can record specific fragments and then join them into one video.
3. Double-check that your video takes ~30min (and not longer than 35 min).
4. Make sure that your video is accessible online.
    - You can upload it to YouTube, Google Drive, Loom storage, etc.
5. Copy the link to your video. It will be needed for this exercise submission and also for requesting an assessment of this module.
