# Group capstone: set up your Kanban board

## Learning objectives
- Use Kanban board with filled-in tasks that have categories and time estimations to assign work in group.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

In this activity, your team will prepare a Kanban board with a GitHub project. As this is the very first group project in your Microverse journey, we prepared a very detailed template (in the upcoming group projects, you will have more freedom regarding that) that you just need to copy.
In order to copy the Kanban board quickly, you will use a special script prepared for you.

### Project requirements

- Join a Zoom call with your team. Only one person needs to copy the board on behalf of the entire team but everybody should help during the call.
- Create an empty repository for your group project.
- Follow the steps described in [curriculum-tools-copy-projects](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-tools-copy-projects).
- Open the GitHub project (Kanban board) in your team repo.
- Make sure that in the card titles you can see: `Student A`, `Student B`, or `Student C`.
- Make sure that each card starts with `[Xpt]` - that number indicates the number of `points` that shows how complex the task is. **1 point = 1 hour of work**.
- _If your group includes two people - remove all cards with `Student C` in the title._
- Decide who in your team is the `Student A`, `Student B`, or `Student C`.
- Each of the team members should assign themselves to the correct cards. Decide who will be the assignee for the cards marked as group tasks. All cards on your Kanban board should have assignees.
- [Open a new issue in your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).
    - In its description, paste a link to your GitHub project.
    - Add a note telling the reviewer how many people there are in your team.
- Use the issue link to ask for a review. A Code Reviewer will leave you feedback in the issue's comment.
    - As it is your first time using a GitHub project and Kanban board, we need to double-check your setup to avoid problems while working on your project.

## Work and submission mode

- You should implement the above requirements only in **one repository** in your group.
- You should ask for a review and submit this activity **on behalf of your group.**

## Code review

Follow [these steps](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/how_to_ask_for_a_code_review.md) to request a code review of your project.
**Special case: instead of a pull request, you need to use an issue to communicate with your reviewer.**

## Submit your project

After the final approval from a code reviewer, you need to submit your project.
[Read this FAQ for a reminder on how to submit your project.](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234)
Close your GitHub issue and go to your Student Dashboard and submit your project.
