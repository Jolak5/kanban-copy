# To Do list: add & remove

## Learning objectives
- Use webpack
- Use ES6 syntax
- Use ES6 modules

### Estimated time: 4h

## Description
In this project, you will implement the CRUD (create, update, delete) methods. All the elements of the user interface will be fully functional and your application will be completed. 

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct flow ([Github Flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### <Section name> requirements
   <as they change by section below you can find list of all possibilities>
	### HTML/CSS requirements
  - Follow our list of the [best practices for HTML & CSS](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/html_css_best_practices.md).
  ### JavaScript requirements
  - Follow our list of [best practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements
- Remove all hardcoded items from the tasks array
- Create a new JavaScript file for the new functionality
- Implement a method for adding a new task (add a new element to the array)
- Implement a method for editing tasks description
- Implement a method for deleting a task (remove an element from the array)
- Implement a method for the "Clear all completed" button (use `filter()` method)
- New tasks by default should have the property `completed` set to `false` and the property `index` set to the value of the new array length (i.e. if you're adding a 5th task to the list, the index of that task should equal to 5)
- Deleting a task should update all remaining items' indexes, so they represent the current list order and are unique
- All changes to the To Do List should be saved in the local storage
