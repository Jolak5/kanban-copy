# To Do list: secure deploy

## Learning objectives
- Deploy a secure website using OpenSSL

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise
Now that your To Do List application is ready, you can deploy it to the public. In this exercise, you will deploy your code via Github Pages. You will need to make sure that your web application uses HTTPS (not HTTP) protocol. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and HTTPS guarantee that all data sent between a browser and a server are being encrypted, which adds a great layer of security for your users and their private and sensitive information.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** instructions before you start this exercise.*

### Instructions 

- Commit and push all your work into the project's GitHub repository
- If you worked with branches, make sure you merge all your work into the Master branch
- In your GitHub repository page go to **Settings** and select **Pages**
- In the *Source* section select `Master` branch and `root` as a folder
- Scroll to the bottom of the **Pages** page and make sure the *"Enforce HTTPS"*  checkbox is selected
- Confirm the deployment. Your application will be live in few minutes. On the top of the **Pages** page you will find your project's URL
