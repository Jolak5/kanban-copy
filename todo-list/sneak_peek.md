# Sneak peek: To Do list

## Learning objectives
- Build a website based on an existing website.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

"To Do list" is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete.
You will build a simple website that allows for doing that, and you will do it with the usage of ES6 and Webpack!


### How to build the "To Do list" website?

You will build a very simple yet powerful To Do list. It will be inspired by the [minimalist](http://www.getminimalist.com/) website.
The final result will look similar to:

You will need to implement the following functionalities:
- Adding a new item.
- Removing selected item.
- Reordering selected item (as drag&drop).
- Marking a selected item as complete.
- Removing all items marked as complete at once.

Go back to the [minimalist](http://www.getminimalist.com/) demo page to play around with the mentioned functionalities.
