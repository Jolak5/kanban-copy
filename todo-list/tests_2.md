# Testing To Do list: part 2

## Learning objectives
- Write unit tests for a JavaScript app.

### Estimated time: 3h

## Description
In this part of the testing project, you will test functions responsible for the status and content updates. You will also test the order re-position of items in the list upon drag/drop actions.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements
- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct [GitHub flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### JavaScript requirements
  - Follow our list of [best practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements
- Use jest framework for testing.
- Create a test file(s) (`[..].test.js`) for a file(s) containing the following functions:
    - a function for editing the task description.
    - a function for updating an item's 'completed' status.
    - the "Clear all completed" function.
- Use the mock storage object you have created in Part 1 of this project to mock the *localStorage* updates.
- Mock the HTML elements to test DOM manipulation functions.
- Make sure you group your tests using the `describe()` method.


### Optional requirements
- Check the *test coverage*. You should aim for covering 100% of your code.

### Need a big picture?
