# Webpack

## Learning objectives

- Use webpack to bundle JavaScript.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description
**Webpack** is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. It's intelligent enough to build all app dependencies based just on your file imports. It starts from a list of modules defined as *entry points* and recursively builds a *dependency graph* that includes every module the application needs. 

### Why is webpack important?
Historically webpack enabled developers to use ES6 modules before any browser implemented support for using them. 
Today webpack also allows for stylesheets and non-code assets, such as images and web fonts, to be used just like module imports thanks to its *dependency graph* and *loaders*. It cares for performance in production and provides a great experience for developers.

To start your adventure with webpack, read about the following topics. Please note that you don't need to follow these steps now - just read it through and we'll set up webpack in our next excercise.
- [Getting started with webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/).
- [Asset management](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/).
- [Output management](https://webpack.js.org/guides/output-management/).
- [Development](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/).
