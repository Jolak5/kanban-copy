# Webpack

## Learning objectives
- Use webpack.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description
**Webpack** is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. It's intelligent enough to build all app dependencies based just on your file imports. It starts from a list of modules defined as *entry points* and recursively builds *dependency graph*, including every module the application needs. 


### Why is webpack important?
Historically webpack was the enabler for using the ES6 Modules before any browser would implement the support for it. Today webpack, thanks to its *dependency graph* and *loaders*, also allows for using stylesheets or non-code assets, such as images and web fonts, just like module imports. It cares for performance in production and gives a great developer experience.
