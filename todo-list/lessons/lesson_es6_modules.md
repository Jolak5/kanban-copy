# ES6 Modules

## Learning objectives
- Learn how to use ES6 modules
- Understand the benefits of modular architecture in JavaScript applications


### Estimated time: 1h

## Description 
The Module Pattern has been around for a long time and is one of the most popular patterns among JavaScript developers. There are many variants of it. Some of the most commonly used are AMD (Asynchronus Module Definition), UMD (Universal Module Definition) and CommonJS (popular in Node.js ecosystem).

ES6 finally brings native support for modules in JavaScript. The implementation of it is excellent both in terms of syntax and functionality.

### Why are Modules important?
To make applications easier to develop and maintain, developers aim to compose them of a set of highly decoupled, distinct pieces of functionality stored in modules.
Modularity allows applications to scale and to be worked on by large number of developers.
Since the introduction of ES6 Modules, the task has never been easier.
